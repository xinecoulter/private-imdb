## Assignment:

* Building on today's movie lab, add actors!
   * What relationship should actors and movies have?

   * How does the IMDB gem store the actors' names? Consider using pry?
   * Create new actors to save to the database.
   * Requirement: check to make sure if a name is already in the database it's not created.
     * Hint: where
  
* You do NOT have to develop CRUD for actors, but you should be able to view them and see with which
movies they are associated.
* Similarly, movies should show the actors associated.
